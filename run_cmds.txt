HOW TO RUN CONTAINERS AND CONNECT VIA NETWORK:

docker network create my-network
docker container run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 --network my-network mongodb:latest
docker container run --name flask-app -d -p 5000:5000 --network my-network flask_mongodb:latest

** IMPORTANT **
If cloning from github, may need to convert importscript.sh from CRLF to LF. If you already built before this, you will need to rebuild after converting, delete the old container, and then run a new one.
