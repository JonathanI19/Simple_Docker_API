# Simple Docker API

## Build

`docker-compose build`

## Run

`docker-compose up -d`

## Important

If cloning from github, may need to convert importscript.sh from CRLF to LF. If you already built before this, you will need to rebuild after converting, delete the old container, and then run a new one.

## Connect

`localhost:80`
